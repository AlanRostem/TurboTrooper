## Ch. 0 - The Fall of XR129

Planet XR129 is inhabited by a modern civilization that came from the Ancient Terra. Its people thrived by the invention of the Z-droids: highly intelligent and adaptive automatons serving the people of XR129. The planet's society was entirely reliant on these obedient automatons to thrive and build a utopia, but this did not last even a century.

The technology in which the Z-droids were built on was lost to time and they started to evolve rapidly, resulting in the people of XR129 losing control of them. The Z-droids broke out a war between human and machine to take over the planet for themselves. 

Planet XR129 contained a hidden energy source found by an infamous warrior and scientist. Using this, he invented the Turbo Suit - a powerful weapon for highly trained soldiers to fight for their planet. With the Turbo Suit utilizing a natural resource and being designed to be used by humans only, the people of XR129 stood a chance against the Z-droids.

## Ch. 1 - A Battle Lost, An Unresolved War

The soldiers wielding the Turbo Suit are known as the Turbo Troopers. Their fighting capabilities involve using powerful weaponry and high mobility, capable of destroying armies at a time. Nevertheless, too many lives were lost and so was the battle. Only one Turbo Trooper remains alive buried in a Z-droid mine.
