# Small ideas

## Biomes - Enemies and environment

- New biome: Core
    - The turbo trooper has breached all factories and is now infiltrating the main CPU controlling all Zdroids
    - Hacking it and disabling it means he has to enter its "Matrix" where the Zdroid AI is being trained
    - He has to defeat AI simulation enemies, such as human soldiers, other Turbo Troopers and Experimental Zdroids
- Core biome enemies
    - AI Turbo Troopers
        - they can slide into you
        - they can shoot sometimes
        - very quick enemy
    - Phazers
        - enemy that "glitches" itself out of reality and reappears near the player
- Core biome objects
    - Null Portal
        - "Portal" that is a bugged part of the simulation
        - Entering it sends the player to the Null Partition (developer mode of the Core)
        - this makes him invulnerable for a few seconds and stops time for all enemies

- Idea: thematically introduce new enemies and objects based on the biome

- Enemies introduced in Cave
    - Arachnoid
    - Cadavetron
    - Terra Brute
    - Rocket Charger
    - Excavatron

- Cave Environmental Objects
    - TNT Barrel
        - Shoot to explode, launching the player away
        - Can also destroy certain debris
    - Rocky Debris
        - Destructible debris with Turbo Slide

-  Enemies introduced in Lab
    - Crusty
        - Has two claws that alternate between being on his sides or both on top of hit head, each protecting him from damage
        - if the player is running or sliding into the claws, he will get caught, be immobilized, thrown away and take damage
    - Cannon Turret
        - Fires bombs in a fixed direction
        - Can be placed in various directions

- Lab Environmental Objects
    - Launch Pad
        - Launches the player upwards and keeps horizontal momentum
    - Spike Trap
        - Spike hazard that deals damage to the player
        - It can be disabled using the default weapon

- Enemies introduced in Factory
    - Razor Flyer
        - Slicer enemy with blades that spin around it. 
        - it flies up and down 
    - Factory Walker
        - Walker enemy with long legs. It can only be attacked by hitting its body, meaning that the legs don't take damage and player can walk under them
        - its critical hitbox is the bottom of his body
        - it shoots a laser beam that charges up and instantly hits the player
        - if the player is under the walker for too long, it will slam down

- Factory Environmental Objects
    - Conveyor Belt
        - Moves the player and boosts his speed in a certain direction
    - 

## Secrets

- Secrets
    - Super Scrap
        - Grants 100 Scrap
        - Gives one health to player, even if he has full health
        - Player can get max three addtional health on top of the base three health
    - Weapon ammo
    - Shortcut portal
        - when the bomb switch is active, the player can take this portal to win the level faster than the normal exit
## Usage ideas for scrap

- Buying items in shops (not sure where shops should be)
    - Replenish Life
    - Replenish Ammo
    - Increase starting life

## Level types

- The idea is to tie the level's theme to the type of level so that I don't need to make too many songs
- Four level types per biome is enough
- Current types
    - Boss
    - Bomb-escape
- Ideas for more
    - Collectibles that unlock a door
        - the player must explore the level and collect the max number of "keys"
        - this unlocks a door and completes the level
    - Rush level
        - this level is after each bomb level
        - the bomb explosion from the previous level is causing a reaction in this level
        - the reaction creates a radiation that moves fast
        - if the player is caught in this radiation they die
        - the player must run as fast as possible to escape
