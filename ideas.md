# Small ideas

- New biome: Core
    - The turbo trooper has breached all factories and is now infiltrating the main CPU controlling all Zdroids
    - Hacking it and disabling it means he has to enter its "Matrix" where the Zdroid AI is being trained
    - He has to defeat AI simulation enemies, such as human soldiers, other Turbo Troopers and Experimental Zdroids
- Core biome enemies
    - AI Turbo Troopers
        - they can slide into you
        - they can shoot sometimes
        - very quick enemy
    - Phazers
        - enemy that "glitches" itself out of reality and reappears near the player
    - 
    
- Idea: make the existing enemies part of the cave biome. Each biome has five total thematic enemies
    - Arachnoid
    - Cadavetron
    - Terra Brute
    - Rocket Charger
    - Excavatron

- Lab Enemies
