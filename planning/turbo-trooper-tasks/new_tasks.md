# Tasks

## Done

- Fix bug where HUD scene loses a reference to the player scene after level transitioning
- Make Beam Cannon (formerly blaster) the default weapon
- Remove Beam Cannon from crates
- Remove sword and crate item for it
- Add new level completion jingle
- New boss and escape theme
- Adjust player hitbox
- Make Scorch Cannon weapon
- Make weapons that require ammo disappear when depleted


## Ideas Needed

- Come up with an incentive to explore levels (i.e., secrets, collectibles)
	- Idea: perks, such as damage boost, infinite power (Turbo Energy), infinite ammo, etc.
- Come up with something else to use scrap on, now that weapons no longer can be purchased
- Come up with a level design trick that incentivises the player to come up with strategies when trying to escape from the bomb timer

## Other

- Add color palette swapping feature (like a "GameBoy Color mode")
- Create an LDtk level loading scheme
	- this achieves easier level design and possibly improves room creation
	- autotiling is customizable this way, fixing the slope corner issue
- Experiment with rooms and camera transitions
- Abstract out the code for bosses
- Make Blast Cannon weapon
- Make Pierce Cannon weapon
- Make Ammo shop
- Remove Beam Cannon and Sword shop

## Game Balance

## Polish

- Make the corners of tiles not be slopes
- Add explosion sound when defeating a boss
