- New biome: Matrix
    - The turbo trooper has breached all factories and is now infiltrating the main CPU controlling all Zdroids
    - Hacking it and disabling it means he has to enter its Matrix where the Zdroid AI is being trained
    - He has to defeat AI simulation enemies, such as human soldiers, other Turbo Troopers and Experimental Zdroids
