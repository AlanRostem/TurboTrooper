# Game Mechanics Changes

## Player Resources 

Each resource is a part of the player

Suit Health: The player starts with three HP. If this HP is depleted, the player dies and respawns at the last save point. They will also lose their equipped weapon upon death. 

Momentum - A meter essentially indicating how fast the player is moving, but also about what type of attack they can use. At a small portion, it also indicates when the player can Turbo Slide. This meter can be built up by constantly moving faster than a certain threshold or by picking up energy orbs dropped by enemies or collected from crates. Some abilities are linked to Momentum, and Turbo Slide consumes this energy. Additionally, weapons have a special attack that needs energy, same amount as needed by Turbo Slide. 

## Player Mechanics

Additional mechanics related to the player.

Bash Attack - If the player is not armed with a weapon, they can dash forward any time to do damage to enemies upon contact and knock them back. This dash stops all movement when done, which is risky.

Aerial Kick - When airborne, the player can do a spin kick that does massive damage to enemies when hit in their critical hitbox which is at the top of their head. After doing damage this way, the player is launched in the air. 

Jump and Run - The player can run and jump with controlled height

Crouch and Slide - The player can crouch under tight spaces or slide into them. The player can also slide down slopes and jump to keep the momentum and reach secret places. 

Turbo Slide - When running for long enough, the player can slide really fast and through debris in tight spaces. This consumes one bar of energy. Turbo sliding into enemies will knock them into the air and damage them. Jumping after a Turbo Slide lets you keep the momentum indefinitely in the air making it good for getting across long jumps.

## Weapons 

The player can pick up weapons they find on the level. If they die, they lose that weapon and become unarmed. Some enemies also drop weapons when dying. This is so that the player can easily maintain having a weapon when playing, since they are crucial to the gameplay. The player can take their weapon the next level if they complete it.

Each weapon has a special attack that consumes Momentum Energy and requires it. It is perfomed by holding down the B button for a second and releasing it. Additonally, aiming downwards while in the air allows for a special movement attack that also consumes energy.

Riot Blade - Melee sword that deals great damage and can slash enemies away from the player. Slashes can be done any time and do not stop the player from moving. Slashing incoming projectiles or attacks will deflect them back at enemies. The special attack releases a spin attack that deals multiple melee blows. Jumping after doing this move lets you spin in the air indefinitely. Aiming downwards and attacking makes the player dash downards in the direction of his movement vector. This attack deals massive damage in the critical box.

Blast Cannon - Energy blaster that shoots fast-moving projectiles. These deal a small amount of damage but can be fired in rapid succession. Special attack lets you shoot a large energy ball that deals great damage and has one-shot crtitcal-hit kill potential. Aiming downwards in the air and firing will propel you slightly upwards so you can stay in the air longer. A charged shot sends a larger energy ball which explodes and knocks enemies away. If you are caught in its explosion, you will also be propelled but at a cost for some extra energy. 

## Enemies

Boom Crawler: One-eyed spider-like robot that can crawl on any surface. If it is close to the player, it blows up, deals one HP of damage and knocks them away. This enemy is very weak and can also be used to rocket-jump. If it is crawling on a ceiling near the player, it will drop down.

Death Rod: Skeleton-like robot that shoots rods that it's made of. It shoots rods in the horizontal direction of the player when it is far enough away, but backs out of the player gets too close. The rods can be deflected by the Riot Blade.

## How Levels Work

Each level is two-way in its completion. The player reaches the end of a level and plants a bomb that detonates in under a minute (time isdepending on the level). Then they have to go back to the start of the level before the bomb explodes. When this happens, some objects will be activated to enable the player's movement. These are indicated as outlines of those objects before the player reaches the end, allowing them to plan ahead before reaching the bomb planting place. These objects include launch pads, teleporters, speed boosters, etc.

## Environmental Objects

Debris - Placed in tight spaces and is there to be destroyed by Turbo Slide or Blaster shots

Null Portal - Teleports the player to the Null Realm, making them immune to all damage and able to pass through certain objects

Spike Trap - A spike that damages the player when touched. Storm Mod qcan disable this trap for a few seconds

Explosive Barrel - Object that explodes and knocks away anything in its blast. The player won't take damage in this blast but will lose Momentum

Launch Pad - Launches the player vertically. Any momentum you build up is stored, making this pair well with Turbo Slide.

## Interactable Objects

## Items 

Buff Core:  Grants the player a Power-Up. It bounces and flies around making it hard for the olayer to pick up

Energy Orb: Orb that grants the player a small amount of Momentum.

Weapon: The weapon the player will use when they pick it up

Health Orb: Grants one out of a max of three health points. If the player is at max HP, this orb gets converted into multiple values of Momentum.

## Buff Cores (Power-Ups)

WARNING: These are just ideas that are not necessary to implement yet, but would be cool as hell :)

Power-ups are temporary buffs that last for a short time or are cleared after completing a level. These can be picked up from crates only. Power-ups can be stacked.

JUST IDEA: Turbo Shield: Every time the player uses Momentum, they get a shield around them that protects them for a short time

Storm Mod: Attacks can disable contraptions such as traps and stun enemies after consecutive hits.

Null Shatter: Launches the player to the Null Dimension with a dash. After a few seconds, he comes back to the real world. Being in the Null Dimension makes him invulnerable but unable to see enemies. The player can also pass through certain objects in this state.

JUST IDEA: Rage Flame: The player's suit becomes overheated with flame which makes him run faster, build Momentum faster and damage enemies he touches. He can still take damage from attacks. This powerup lasts only a few seconds.
